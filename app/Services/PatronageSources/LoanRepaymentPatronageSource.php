     * Patronage from loan repayments is based on income components only:

     * The patronage_basis setting controls whether late fees are included:
     *   - 'total_repayment': includes late fees (income components + late_fee)
     *   - 'net_repayment': excludes late fees (income components only)
     *
     * Fallback: only when the income breakdown is genuinely unavailable
     * (interest_paid or service_fee_paid is NULL for legacy records) does the
     * full amount_paid count as patronage. Legitimate zero-income repayments
     * (columns present, value 0) are NOT treated as patronage, so principal
     * repayment is never counted when an income breakdown exists.
